Hey there,

It has been almost a year since I first started tinkering with the idea of Lucia. Through this process, I've been lucky to enjoy learning more library fundamentals and what it takes to create a project of this size. Additionally, I've been fortunate to receive relative success through ISEF and GitHub stars, with thanks to [`shadowtime2000`](https://github.com/shadowtime2000), [`candry`](https://github.com/candry), and [`willdoescode`](https://github.com/willdoescode).

However, my time on Lucia is coming to an end, as I want to explore more areas in software development, as I am still young and have much to learn and experience. I'm looking for new maintainers to take over Lucia to pass down, as I still believe that it has high potential in regards to the greater webdev community.

Please [create a discussion](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/discussions/new) if you are interested.
