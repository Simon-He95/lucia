Hey there,

It has been almost a year since I first started tinkering with the idea of Lucia. Through this process, I've been lucky to enjoy learning about creating a library and experience managing an open source project. Additionally, I've been fortunate to receive relative success I'm **[extremely](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/graphs/contributors) [grateful](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24887968) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/jhi523/lucia_the_3kb_jquery_replacement/) [everyone](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/stargazers)** who has supported me throughout this amazing journey.

However, I am still young and have much to experience, so **my time on Lucia is coming to an end**. I'm looking for new maintainers to take over Lucia to pass down, as I still believe that it has a lot of potential.

By no means is this a message to abandon the project, rather I want to decrease my influence on it and **focusing on supporting it** rather than actively developing features.

Please [**create a discussion**](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/discussions/new) if you are interested in taking over the project.
